    Generate a SOC-style Recommended Actions Report for each host in scan_data.

    Accepts output from risk_scoring.process_all_hosts() (canonical) or

    normalised internally — no preprocessing required by the caller.

    Parameters
    ----------
    scan_data : list[dict]
        List of host dicts.  Each dict must contain either an 'ip' or 'host'
